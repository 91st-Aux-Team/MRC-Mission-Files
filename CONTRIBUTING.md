# Contributing to 91st MRC's Mission Fies

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the 91st MRC Clone Wars Unit Arma 3 Mission Files repository! Your contributions help us improve the missions and enhance the experience for all our players. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

## Cloning the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork"  button at the top right corner of this repository's page. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Fork:** Open [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and click on the "Clone a repository from the internet" option. Select your forked repository from the list and choose a directory on your computer to save the local copy.

## Adding Files and Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. This helps keep the main branch clean and allows you to work on your changes separately. In GitHub Desktop, click the "Current Branch" dropdown and select "New Branch." Give your branch a descriptive name related to the changes you're making.

2. **Make Changes:** Add or modify the mission files you'd like to contribute within your local repository directory.

3. **Commit Changes:** In GitHub Desktop, you'll see a list of changed files. Add a brief, descriptive commit message explaining the changes you've made. Click the "Commit to <your-branch-name>" button.

4. **Push Changes:** After committing your changes, click the "Push origin" button to send your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Open Pull Request:** Visit your forked repository on GitHub in a web browser. You should see a notification prompting you to create a new pull request based on your recently pushed changes. Click on that notification.

2. **Compare Changes:** Make sure the "base" branch is set to the main repository's branch, and the "compare" branch is set to your newly created branch with changes.

3. **Review Changes:** Provide a clear and concise title for your pull request and describe the changes you've made in the comment box. Be sure to follow any contribution guidelines mentioned in the repository's README or elsewhere.

4. **Create Pull Request:** Once you're satisfied, click the "Create pull request" button. Your pull request will be submitted for review.

## Review and Collaboration

The repository maintainers will review your changes and may provide feedback or request modifications. You can continue to make updates to your pull request by pushing changes to your branch in your forked repository.

Thank you for contributing to the 91st Mission Files repository! Your efforts help us create a better experience for everyone.
