# Setting up Git & GitHub

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files over time. It is used by developers to collaborate on projects and keep track of changes to code. Git is also used by GitHub, a popular website for hosting Git repositories.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories. It allows users to collaborate on projects and share code with others. GitHub also provides tools for managing issues, pull requests, and other features that make it easier to work together on projects.

## Make a GitHub Account

Before you can start using Git, you need to create an account on GitHub. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/join) and sign up for an account. You will need to verify your email address before you can use your account.

## Install Git

Git is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download the latest version of Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the instructions to install Git on your computer.

## Configure Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your name and email address. Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```

Replace "Your Name" and "Your Email" with your actual name and email address. These settings will be used when you commit changes to your repository.
